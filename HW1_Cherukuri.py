# re:               This module hepls us to match string patterns and remove unwanted symbols and data using
#                   regular expressions from string or text provided as the input.

# numpy:            This is a Numpy module which helps us to handle huge arrays while working on this kind of 
#                   projects.

# Pandas:           This package is used for handling the data and performing operations such as data loading, 
#                   data analysis, data visualization.

# accuracy_score:   This function helps us to calculate the accuracy of the model basing on the predictions made
#                   and test data.

# nltk:             This package is used when dealing with natural language, this package provides all the 
#                   neccessary functions to handle natural language grammar, semantics. 
#                   Also we used WordNetLemmatizer which lemmatizes the words & eliminates duplicates.        
#                   stopwords is also used to filter out the stopwords such as prepositions in english vocabulary.

# TfidfVectorizer:  This helps assign a term frequency for each word in the text data that we are working with.

# train_test_split: This is used to split the whole data into train and test basing on the split percent we set.

# confusion_matrix: This is used to calculate confusion matrix such as true +ve, true -ve, false +ve, false -ve

# TruncatedSVD:     This module is used for dimensionality reduction, works efficiently with sparse matrix

# classification_report: This is used to get all the metrics sudh as accuracy, f1-score, precision and recall values.

# seaborn:          This is a visualization package, helps plot heatmaps and graphs.
